# Stock-Price-prediction-by-simple-RNN-and-LSTM
# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM and RNN

This project demonstrates the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for predicting stock prices. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Python.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a deep learning model that can predict future stock prices based on historical data. The architecture includes LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies in the input sequences.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib
Dataset
For this project, you need a dataset containing historical stock prices. The dataset should include at least one column for the closing prices.
Usage
Data Preparation:

Load your stock price dataset.
Preprocess and normalize the data if necessary.
Model Training:

Adjust the model parameters in the provided Python script (stock_price_prediction.py).
Run the script to train the model.
bash
Copy code
python stock_price_prediction.py
Evaluation:

Evaluate the model performance on a test set.
Prediction:

Use the trained model to make future stock price predictions.
File Structure
stock_price_prediction.py: Main script for defining, training, and evaluating the LSTM and RNN model.
data_preprocessing.py: Script for loading and preprocessing the dataset.
requirements.txt: List of project dependencies.
Customization
Feel free to customize the model architecture, hyperparameters, and data preprocessing steps based on your specific dataset and requirements.
